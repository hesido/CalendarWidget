# CalendarWidget
Simple Blender Panel that lets the user input a date/time and animate the datetime with keyframes.

The Calendar Widget lets you set a date, which is stored in a custom-property in the scene. It also allows you to set a keyframe on a user-defined custom property on any-object, so that the date can be animated.
